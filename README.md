# Machine Learning Assisted Dual Harmonic Generation FROG for Enhanced Ultrafast Pulse Recovery

This is the collaboration project for ultrafast laser pulse response prediction between Heriot-Watt University and the University of St Andrews 

This is the mock model code for the paper. As the paper states, using the encoder-decoder model performs roughly the same as using Resnet9. 
The code is shared so people can do similar projects without trouble. if you like our project, please reference our paper.
